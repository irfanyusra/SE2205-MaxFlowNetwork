# Algorithms and Data Structures - Maximum Flow in a Network
Implementing an algorithm that computes the maximum flow possible in a flownetwork digraph.

## Objectives
In this assignment, you will implement an algorithm that computes the maximum flow possible in a flow
network digraph. A flow network can represent a network of pipelines having different flow rates. Please
refer to the diagram in Figure 1 for an example of a flow network. In a flow network, there are two special
nodes called the source and destination nodes (marked as S and D in Figure 1). Material such as oil
fluids can propagate through the network starting from the source S and flow into the destination node D.
Intermediate nodes (i.e. 1 to 7 in the example) can represent pumping stations.
